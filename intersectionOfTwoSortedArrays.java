Intersection of two sorted arrays

Problem Statement: Find the intersection of two sorted arrays. OR in other words, Given 2 sorted arrays, find all the elements which occur in both the arrays.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input: 
A: [1 2 3 3 4 5 6]
, B: [3 3 5]
Output: 3,3,5
Explanation: We are given two arrays A and B. 
The elements present in both the arrays  
are 3,3 and 5.

Example 2:
Input: 
A: [1 2 3 3 4 5 6]
B: [3 5]
Output: 3,5
Explanation: We are given two arrays A and B. 
The elements present in both the arrays are 3 and 5.

Brute Force Approach:
For the brute force approach, we are given 2 arrays, we take an element from array A and search if it is present in array B on the condition that the same element in array B hasnâ€™t been traversed before by any duplicate element in array A.

For Example:

A: [1 2 3 3 4 5 6] 
B: [3 3 5]
We first create a visited array for array B which is initialized with 0 indicating that initially none of the elements of array B are visited.
We start checking the first element from array A if it matches with any element of array B which is not yet visited. If they match, we mark the element in array B as visited, put the element in ans array, and move to the next element in array A.
If the element matches but is already being visited before, we do not add it to the ans array concluding that the element has been mapped to some other element previously.
After iterating the whole of Array A, we get the intersection of two arrays stored in the ans array.

          // if element matches and has not been matched with any other before

          visited[j] = 1;

      System.out.print(ans.get(i) + " ");
